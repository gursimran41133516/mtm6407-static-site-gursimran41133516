### **Using Jekyll as a Static Site Generator**

**Jekyll** is a static site generator that takes text written in various formats (e.g., Markdown, HTML) and turns it into a static website. It simplifies the process of creating and managing static sites like personal blogs, portfolios, or documentation.

### **Steps to Create the Site Using Jekyll**

1. **Install Jekyll and Bundler**  
   Jekyll requires Ruby and Bundler to be installed:
   ```bash
   gem install jekyll bundler
   ```

2. **Create a New Jekyll Site**  
   Generate a new site with:
   ```bash
   jekyll new my-site
   cd my-site
   ```

3. **Run the Local Server**  
   To preview the site locally:
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```
   Access the site at `http://localhost:4000`.

4. **Customize the Site**  
   - Edited `_config.yml` to set site details (`title`, `description`, `author`, `theme`, etc.).
   - Created additional content pages such as **Photography**, **Travel**, and **Coding Projects**.
   - Updated the navigation bar in the `default.html` layout.

5. **Test Locally**  
   Verified that the site navigation and content were working correctly on the local server.

6. **Host the Site on Netlify**
